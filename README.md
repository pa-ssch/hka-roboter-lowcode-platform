# hka-robot-lowcode-platform

There is no need to build the project by yourself. All stable functionality is available here:
[silasderprofi.github.io/hka-roboter-lowcode-platform](https://silasderprofi.github.io/hka-roboter-lowcode-platform/)


## Repository
This repo contains three directories:

* [Low_Code_Platform](/Low_Code_Platform)
  - Source code of the lowcode platform. New robot adapters can also be added here to be able to control more robots via the platform.
* [Vector_Adapter_SDK_Mapper](/Vector_Adapter_SDK_Mapper)
  - Interface between lowcode platform and the Vector robot. Such an interface is not necessary for every robot.
* [docs](/docs)
  - Contains the deployed files of the low-code platform.



Feel free to contribute.
